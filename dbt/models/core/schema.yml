      This model corresponds to the staging details table for road traffic accidents.  
      It applies an initial level of cleaning and filtering on raw data sourced from the `details.csv` file.

      In particular, **accidents that occurred in overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM)** are deliberately **excluded** from the analytical scope:
      `971` (Guadeloupe), `972` (Martinique), `973` (French Guiana), `974` (RÃ©union), `975` (Saint Pierre and Miquelon),  
      `976` (Mayotte), `977`, `978` (Saint BarthÃ©lemy and Saint Martin), `984` (French Southern Territories),  
      `986` (Wallis and Futuna), `987` (French Polynesia), `988` (New Caledonia), `989` (Saint Pierre and Miquelon).

      ðŸ‘‰ **Filtering rationale:**
      - These territories present very different geographic, social, and road infrastructure characteristics compared to mainland France.
      - The primary analytical scope of this project focuses exclusively on mainland French departments.
      - This exclusion ensures greater statistical consistency when comparing data across departments.
